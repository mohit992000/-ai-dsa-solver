# 🧠 AI DSA Solver

AI DSA Solver is an open-source tool that reads, understands, and solves data structure & algorithm problems using OpenAI's GPT models.

It’s built for learners, developers, and educators who want to practice smarter — not harder.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- 📄 Parses natural language coding problems
- 🔍 Detects the algorithm type (e.g. recursion, binary search, DP)
- 🧠 Generates Python solutions using GPT-3.5/4
- ✅ Runs test cases and shows verdict
- 🔐 Obfuscates variable names to reduce plagiarism and preserve originality
